### Reasons for continued development:

- I had fun building this.
- I'm interested in learning technologies I was planning on using in future releases like PDF creation, drag/drop, and maybe HTML5 canvas.
- I could use another portfolio piece.
- I couldn't find an existing example repo of or blog post about a React greeting/Christmas card creator even though there are web apps that do this, which makes the idea unique.
- I wasn't completely happy or satisfied with what I produced in the given time and would like to see for myself what I could do under my own motivation.
