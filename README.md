### [Development branch](https://covid-free-card-creator-git-changes-after-deadline.wildair.vercel.app/)

I will be continually making updates to this repo under the [`Changes-after-deadline`](https://github.com/wildpow/covid-free-card-creator/tree/Changes-after-deadline) branch and will be deployed [here](https://covid-free-card-creator-git-changes-after-deadline.wildair.vercel.app/).
<span style="color: darkred; font-weight: bold;">Commits will not be merged due to being made after theÂ¬â€ allottedÂ¬â€ timeframe.Â¬â€ </span>

### Reasons for continued development:

- I had fun building this.
- I'm interested in learning technologies I was planning on using in future releases like PDF creation, drag/drop, and maybe HTML5 canvas.
- I could use another portfolio piece.
- I couldn't find an existing example repo of or blog post about a React greeting/Christmas card creator even though there are web apps that do this, which makes the idea unique.
- I wasn't completely happy or satisfied with what I produced in the given time and would like to see for myselfÂ what I could do under my own motivation.
